MazeSolver
---------

This application allows the user to create and solve a maze with Breadth First Search and 
Depth First Search algorithms (BFS DFS). It includes a GUI which allows for manual maze 
changes.

To set a wall, left click on a square. To unset, left click again. 
While the maze is being solved, the red squares denote the visited
nodes.When finished, the path found by the algorithms are
denoted in green. Also, some stats are being output in the log pane

The rest of the app should be self-explanatory.

The binary has been compiled on Windows8 for 32 bit systems. You'll need the QT libraries in your
path to run it.

This application is relased under the LGPL and written in QT C++. 
If you find this software useful or are using it I'd be happy about an email.
